1 - Suddenly, our monitoring systems have started reporting low disk space in our ElasticSearch clusters! I knew it! These hipster databases can never be any good! And now /var/log/elasticsearch is growing like if there was no tomorrow! What can we do about it?

    Idk. A suggestion might be to use logrotate to compress old log files.

2 - Somehow, the application starts returning HTTP 500 errors. We have a very poor logging system so the only option is to SSH into the web servers and when we tail the logs, we find lots of errors trying to connect to the database. How would you check the network is working correctly and you can contact a MySQL server called 'holaluz-rds-master' which should be listening on the default MySQL port?

    The easiest way should be pinging to the server where MySQL server is running and/or trying to connect with mysql cli.

3 - There seems to be a problem in our EC2 instance. We have been able to SSH but the website is still blank. How can we know if Apache / Nginx is running?

    Connect with SSH and check if they're running with "service apache2 status" and "service nginx status".

4 - Ansible stopped working and we had to SSH some production servers and manually edit some files. Only VIM is available there! The horror! We have applied our changes but how do we save the file and exit VIM?

    Press ESC key and then type :wq
    VIM is the evil.
