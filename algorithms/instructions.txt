Hi!

First of all, don't panic! 
We don't expect you to implement any algorithms, just use things PHP has in its Standard Library

1 - sorting.php - We want to find who are our top clients in order to send them a gift! Please write some code to order ClientReadings by reading in descending order

2 - strings.php - Data privacy is really important to us. Unfortunately, some bugs can only be reproduced if we have actual production data to validate against. Please write a super secure encryption algorithm changing all these occurences of chars to the cyphered version:
   A, a -> 4
   E, e -> 3
   I, i -> 1
   O, o -> 0
   B, b -> 8
   S, s -> 6

So, names like Ricard will become R1c4rd, Javi will become J4v1 and so on...

3 - matrices.php - Oh dear, our team of data analysts is giving us a list of clientReadings in a matrix form! And our CEO needs to know ASAP what is the maximum reading we have in the system! Please write a function which returns the maximum value in the matrix!!!!
