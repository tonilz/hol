Welcome to Holaluz Technical Test for PHP Engineers

We have divided the test into 3 areas:

Algorithms: Where you will find 3 easy exercises to get yourself into action (don't worry, there are no stupid graph or binary trees questions!). Please follow the instructions inside that folder. You should be able to complete this in 15 minutes.

Miscellaneous: Where you will get a number of questions about real life problems. It is ok if you don't know most of the answers (or any at all!) but this lets us compare your systems skills against other backend candidates. You should be able to complete this in 20-30 minutes.

OOProgramming: Where you will find an exercise where you need to create a command line application which can do energy readings fraud detection. This is the longest part of the exam and although you can complete it in 1h or so, we expect you to show your skillset here! Please follow the instructions inside the folder!

Finally, we would appreciate your feedback on this test. 
We know it is tedious to do them but it also takes a lot of time to prepare them and make them fair for everybody.

Good luck and we are waiting for your answers!
